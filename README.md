What is a terminal?
A application provides text-based access to the operating system, in contrast to the mostly graphical nature of the user experience
of macOS, by providing a command line interface to the operating system when used in conjunction with a Unix shell, such as bash.


What about vim?
Vim is just a text editor, like your Notepad, emacs, etc... Just better.
